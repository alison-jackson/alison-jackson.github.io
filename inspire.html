        <h2>What is a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone you look up to for any reason. Heroes can represent who you want to be like someday, or someone you admire. Often, your heroes reflect your personality, character, and what you value most.</p>
        <p>As a female, person of color, and competitive swimmer, Simone Manuel is the best role model. She was the first African American swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal, leading by example and showing everyone that you can do anything you set your mind to, no matter if it has never been done before.</p>
